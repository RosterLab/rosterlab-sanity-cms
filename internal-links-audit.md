### 📋 Recommendations

1. **Test Page**: Review if `/test-2` should be accessible in production
2. **Dynamic Content**: Ensure CMS has content for all dynamic routes (blog posts, case studies, newsroom)
3. **ROI Calculator**: The ROI calculator is properly linked and the page exists
4. **Consistent Navigation**: Header and Footer components contain the main navigation with all links properly configured

### 🔍 Link Patterns
